üì¶ Predictive Maintenance Model for Manufacturing Machine
This project focuses on building a predictive maintenance model to forecast machine failures in a manufacturing environment. Using sensor data and historical maintenance logs, the model predicts when a machine is likely to fail, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing downtime.

üîß Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleansing, normalization, and feature engineering of sensor data.

Machine Learning Model: Trained using algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, or LSTM (depending on your implementation).

Failure Prediction: Classifies machinery condition into normal or at-risk states, or predicts remaining useful life (RUL).

Evaluation Metrics: Precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, or regression metrics for RUL models.

Deployment Ready: Can be integrated into a real-time monitoring system or dashboard.

üß∞ Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch)

Jupyter Notebooks

Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization

Optional: Streamlit/Flask for dashboard or API

üìÅ Use Cases
Reduce unplanned machine downtime

Optimize maintenance scheduling

Increase operational efficiency in manufacturing
